### Special Thanks
* [Matt Layher](https://github.com/mdlayher) For his [subfs](https://github.com/mdlayher/subfs) project, which this project was based on.

### Notice
drivefs can only run on *nix systems. You will need the FUSE package for your OS installed(not the FUSE clib). For OSX you will need [OSXFUSE](http://osxfuse.github.io/).
